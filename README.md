This repository contains a Julia function that produces an unexpected negative output when a negative number is provided as input. The function aims to square the input, but due to how Julia handles the exponentiation operator (`^`) with negative numbers, the result is incorrect.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to handle the squaring of negative numbers in Julia to achieve the intended functionality.
